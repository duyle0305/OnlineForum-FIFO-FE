                    FIFO is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the FIFO users.
                    Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect
                    with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find—or even create—your home on FIFO.
                </Typography.Paragraph>

                <Typography.Paragraph>
                    While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no
                    community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their
                    members, not try to diminish it for others. Likewise, everyone on FIFO should have an expectation of
                    privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.
                </Typography.Paragraph>

                <Typography.Paragraph>
                    Every community on FIFO is defined by its users. Some of these users help manage the community as
                    moderators. The culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by
                    moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members.
                    Please abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in
                    which you are not a member.
                </Typography.Paragraph>

                <Typography.Paragraph>
                    Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on FIFO.
                    These rules are enforced by us, the admins.
                </Typography.Paragraph>

                <Typography.Paragraph>
                    FIFO and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by
                    a shared set of rules. We ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit
                    as well.

                    <Typography.Paragraph>
                        Remember the human. FIFO is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking
                        marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use FIFO free of 
                        <u>harassment</u>, <u>bullying</u>, and threats of <u>violence</u>. Communities and users that
                        incite violence or that promote hate based on <u>identity or vulnerability</u> will be banned.

                    <Typography.Paragraph>
                        Abide by community rules. Post authentic content into communities where you have a personal
                        interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including <u>spamming</u>, 
                        <u>vote manipulation</u>, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or
                        disrupt FIFO communities.

                        Respect the privacy of others. Instigating harassment, for example by revealing someone’s 
                        <u>personal or confidential information</u>, is not allowed. Never post or threaten to post 
                        <u>intimate or sexually-explicit media</u> of someone without their consent.

                        involving minors. Any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor is also strictly
                        prohibited.

                        You don’t have to use your real name to use FIFO, but don’t <u>impersonate</u> an individual or
